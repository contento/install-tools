# install-tools

A PowerShell Script to install some tools that I really like/depend on.

Please review the default configuration file [tools.yaml](./tools.yaml) and make updates according to your needs.

## Execute

Just run:

    ./Install-Tools.ps1

> 👉 Relies heavily on [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org)

## TODO

- [ ] Add more configurations
